# Contributing Guidelines

- Branches: `main` (stable), `dev` (integration), `feature/*`.
- Commits: `feat(status): thirst decay curve`, `fix(combat): knockback clamp`.
- PRs must include: **Steps to reproduce**, **Acceptance checks**, **Perf notes**.
- Avoid exposing raw numbers in UI; only use test keybinds during development.
