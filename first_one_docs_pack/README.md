# First One — Immersive HUD & Survival Systems (Forge 1.20.1)

This pack contains the **project blueprint, API contracts, data formats, task cards, and roadmap** for the “First One” mod — an immersive, low‑GUI survival overhaul inspired by titles like Escape from Tarkov and Dying Light. It replaces numeric HUD bars with in‑world signals and **subjective cues** like “我有点饿 / I feel a bit hungry,” and routes information through **diegetic tools** (watch, compass, field notes).

Use this docs pack to guide development across multiple contributors (including AI assistants). The source files are standalone and can be dropped into your repo under `/docs` or `/design`.
