# Task Cards (MVP)

## A0 — Scaffolding & Encumbrance MVP
- [ ] Cancel vanilla HUD overlays (health/food/armor/xp/potions/crosshair).
- [ ] Datapack‑driven item metrics + penalties (walk speed, jump, stamina baseline).
- [ ] Subjective hint bus (cooldown, priority).

## A1 — Subjective States (Heat/Thirst/Fatigue)
- [ ] Hidden stat pools; server‑authoritative.
- [ ] Tier mapping → zh_cn/en_us lines; VFX/SFX hooks.
- [ ] Handheld “instruments” (watch/thermometer/compass) for numeric reads.

## A2 — Scavenge Prototype
- [ ] Placeable test container; chest open animation; timed refresh.
- [ ] Noise/aggro weight plumbed (no AI changes yet).

## A3 — Combat Primitives
- [ ] Directional knockback clamp + hitstun micro camera sway.
- [ ] Sprint collisions and slowed recovery.
- [ ] Simple downed camera (no third‑person swap).

## A4 — Perf/Net
- [ ] Tick budgets enforced; client receives tiers not raw numbers.
- [ ] 2‑player sync tests; packet compression where relevant.
