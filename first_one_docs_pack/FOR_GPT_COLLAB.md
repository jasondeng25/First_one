# Assistant Collaboration Notes

- Always preserve **diegetic UX**. No numeric HUD unless via instruments.
- Respect dataâ€‘driven design; add new states/lines via datapack/lang first.
- When in doubt, write **tests in PR description** as player walkthroughs.
- Keep zh_cn and en_us in sync for keys under `first_one.feel.*`.
